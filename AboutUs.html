				<h4>Vision</h4>
				<p>To see the communities we serve; OBTAIN, MAINTAIN and LIVE
					quality and meaningful lives, good education and responsibility to
					themselves and others.</p>
				<h4>Mission</h4>
				<p>To care for, nature, mentor and develop children, Youth women
					and men in need, in order for them to become balanced, well-adapted
					and independent future leaders.</p>
				<h4>What we do</h4>
				<p>Undugu Charities is a non-profit Organization striving to
					empower, support, educate and develop communities through volunteer
					work and charity donations. "Undugu" is a Swahili word meaning
					"brotherhood". We work with local non-profits, community leaders,
					schools, businesses, churches and various individuals to identify
					the needs and priorities in communities. We engage the youth
					through talent development; we believe helping young people to
					achieve their full potential is the best way to: - prevent them
					from engaging in risky behavior, prepare them to become future
					leaders, help them achieve a spirit of selflessly helping others.
					We also believe youth can change this world into a better place!
					And so, their self confidence, trust and knowledge should be
					positively boosted at an early state.</p>
				<h4>In Africa</h4>
				<p>We reach out to children orphaned by the violent conflicts,
					HIV/AIDS scourge and other diseases to provide them with shelter
					and adopt them to a family setting, where they also get opportunity
					to attain formal education through our partners. Youth talent
					empowerment and development is highly emphasized and as a result we
					have a performing troupe called Undugu Family Performers in Kampala
					Uganda. We also train our youths in art and craft making like
					weaving, painting, and making all other sorts of African crafts,
					mainstreaming this with formal education, we are sure that our
					children and youth grow up with a variety of talents to make use of
					for essential sustainability. Uganda being our first African
					beneficially country, we hope to expand to other East African
					Countries like Kenya, Tanzania and Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
				<h4>In Los Angeles, California</h4>
				<p>Undugu Charities works with African immigrants to Los
					Angeles. Many immigrants reach here as Asylum seekers, Refugees,
					Diversity Visa immigrants, Employment-Based Immigrants or i-130
					petition status. Some like Refugees and Asylum seekers reach here
					with no single idea of what to do, some are ill advised and end up
					taking erroneous choices which make them liabilities to themselves,
					the community and the government. The same applies to other types
					of immigrants like Diversity Visa immigrants, Employment-Based,
					i-130 Status and their children; many of them fail to take
					equitable choices because of the baseless wrong advices they
					receive.</p>
